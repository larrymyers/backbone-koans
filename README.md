# Backbone Koans

A set of jasmine powered koans for learning [Backbone.js](http://http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone).

The koans verify behavior of a Todo list app, a modified version of the original Todos app
created by [Jérôme Gravel-Niquet](http://jgn.me/).

## How to Run

Open your favorite browser, and load the specrunner.html file. You should see many failing specs.

If you have python on your machine, here's an easy way to do that:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    http://localhost:8000/

Work your way through the jasmine specs in the js/koans directory, and when you finish you should have
a better understanding of how to create and test a Backbone app.
